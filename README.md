# DOCKER 101/A â€“ UCREL NLP SUMMER SCHOOL EDITION

This session is being in a hybrid lecture format - this means you can choose your own engagement! If you prefer to just listen along with the demonstration or dive in head-first with the worksheet instructions, feel free!

We encourage you to use the lab desktops for this to simplify things, but if you do want to use your own laptop, please install one of the following:

- Podman Desktop - [https://podman-desktop.io/](https://podman-desktop.io/)
- Docker Desktop - [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

On the lab PCs and the instructions here, we will be using Podman, but if you have Docker installed simply replace any instance of `podman` in the instructions with `docker` and the commands should be equivalent.
If you have any issues, please ask.
